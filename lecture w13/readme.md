**Dimensionality Reduction**
- if the algorithm forces the model to use all variables, including those that are not useful. If you are using a parametric and linear model, these models will theoretically want to include all variables in the model;
- when we want to make the model simpler for any reason. For example, when you want to interpret the mathematical model more easily or when we want to use less computing power.
 
There are two main motivations for reducing the number of input variables in a dataset.
